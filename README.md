# FauxmoESP
***Alexa support for ESP8266, ESP32, Raspberry Pi Pico W***

This is a modified version of [FauxmoESP library by vintlabs](https://github.com/vintlabs/fauxmoESP). This version supports color control using hue, saturation, and color temperature.

This is a library for ESP8266/ESP32-based/Raspberry Pi Pico W devices that emulates Philips Hue lights and thus allows you to control them using this protocol, in particular from Alexa-powered devices like the Amazon Echo or the Dot.
